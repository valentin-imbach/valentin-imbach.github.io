Let $(M, d)$ be a metric space. We say that a sequence $a_1,a_2,\dots$ in $M$ *converges* to $a\in M$, if for each real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a positive integer $N$ such that $d(a_n, a) < \varepsilon$ for all $n\geq N$. In this case, we say that the sequence is *convergent* and call $a$ a *limit* of the sequence.
