name: Continous Function

For two metric spaces $(M, d)$ and $(M', d')$ we call a function $f:M\to M'$ *continuous* at $x\in M$ if for every real $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a real $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $y\in M$ with $d(x, y) < \delta$ we have $d'(f(x), f(y)) < \varepsilon$. If $f$ is continuous at every $x\in M$ we just call $f$ continuous.
