			<h3>Mathematical Olympiad</h3>
			<p>
				I am the Academic Director of the annual Swiss Mathematical Olympiad, a mathematical contest for high schoolers from all around Switzerland. Together with other volunteers, I create exam questions, write teaching material, organise training camps and acompany the best students every year to international competitions.

			<h3>Research Interest</h3>
			<p>
				My main reaseacrh interests are in mathematical logic and computation theory. Topics that fascinate me include the interplay of determinism and non-determinism in Complexity Theory, as well as the relationship of different models of computation such as Automata, Formal Grammars and the Lambda Calculus.

			<h3>Mathematical Outreach</h3>
			<p>
				I am on a mission to bring the joy of mathematics to a wider audience. With growing complexity of technology and social structures in our society, abstract reasoning and problem solving skills are more important than ever before. My goal is to improve mathematical education in order to reduce the widespread dislike of the subject.

			<h3>Game Development</h3>
			<p>
				I am working on my own video game which I am from scratch wusing the c++ programming language. My vision is to create procedural worlds which the player can explore and interact with. I set myself the goal to create all parts of the project by myself, including the code, the sound and the art.
