<h1>Problem Portfolio</h1>

This is a collection of some of my original problems that appeared at past mathematical competitions. For some of them, partial credit goes to my deer colleagues at the Swiss Mathematical Olympiad whom I can always rely on to find ways around my intended solutions.

{% assign years = site.portfolio | group_by: 'year' | sort: 'name' | reverse %}
{% for year in years %}
  <h2>{{ year.name }}</h2>
  {% for problem in year.items %}
    <h3>{{ problem.exam }} {{ problem.year }}{% if problem.version %} ({{ problem.version }}){% endif %} â€“ Problem {{ problem.number }}</h3>
    {{ problem.content }}
