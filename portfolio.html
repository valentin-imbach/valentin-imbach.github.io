<h1>Problem Portfolio</h1>

This is a collection of some of my original problems that appeared at past mathematical competitions. For some of them, partial credit goes to my colleagues at the Swiss Matheamtical Olympiad whom I can always rely on to find ways around my intended solutions.

{% assign grouped = site.portfolio | group_by: 'exam' | sort: 'name'%}

{% for group in grouped %}
  <h1>{{ group.name }}</h1>
  {% assign sorted = group.items | group_by: 'year' | sort: 'name'%}
  {% for year in sorted %}
    {% assign ordered = year.items | sort: 'problem'%}
    {% for problem in ordered %}
      <h2>{{ problem.exam }} {{ problem.year }}{% if problem.version %} ({{ problem.version }}){% endif %} â€“ Problem {{ problem.number }}</h2>
      <p>{{ problem.content }}</p>
      <br>
    {% endfor %}
  {% endfor %}
