title: Problem Portfolio
---

This is a collection of some of my original problems that appeared at past mathematical competitions. For some of them, partial credit goes to my deer colleagues at the Swiss Mathematical Olympiad whom I can always rely on to find ways around my intended solutions. Problems are stated as they appeared in the competition.
