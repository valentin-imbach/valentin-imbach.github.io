### Ultimate
At the beginning of my bachelor's studies in Cambridge I discovered the sport of Ultimate, a dynamic teamsport played with a flying disc (more commonly known as a frisbee). Ultimate is a non-contact sport, maximising the technical and tactical aspects and allowing play with mixed-genered teams. There was a lot of Ultmate to be played in Cambridge where many Colleges, the Univerity and the town each had their own clubs. Starting out at the Trinity College Ultimate Club, I quickly improved and soon after made it onto the Univerity team. Spending my long sommer breaks back home in Switzerland, I also joined the club in Zürich where I played until I moved to Lausanne for my PhD, joining the Lausanne club soon after.
