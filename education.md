I grew up in Zürich, Switzerland, and discovered my affinity for mathematics while participating
in many national and international [mathematics competitions](olympiad.html) during my high school
years at MNG Rämibühl. In 2018, I attended the [PROMYS Europe](https://promys-europe.org/) Summer School
in Oxford where I got my first taste of academia. For my high school graduation project in 2019,
I wrote an exposition entitled [On the Probabilistic Method and Permutations](matura.pdf).

### Undergrad

I received my bachelor's (**BA**) and master's (**MMath**) degrees in 2023 after completing
the full [Mathematical Tripos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Tripos) at Trinity College
of the University of Cambridge. Enjoying a wide range of [courses](/courses.html) on pure mathematics,
I soon discovered my passion for its foundations, in particular logic and computation theory.
I wrote my final master's project (Part III Essay) entitled
[Transfinite Context-Free Generative Grammars](/downloads/essay.pdf) on extensions of classical
formal language results to words of transfinite length.

At Cambridge University, the Master's of Arts (**MA**) degree is conferred by right on holders
a certain amount of time after the beginning of their bachelor's studies.
This will apply to me after spring 2026.

I was honoured to be elected president of the [Trinity Mathematical Society](https://tms.soc.srcf.net/),
as well as captain at the Cambridge University Ultimate Club [Strange Blue](https://www.strangeblue.org/).

<!-- It was during my high school years that I decided to pursue mathematics at university. At the time, I participated in many mathematics competitions, through which I discovered my passion for the subject. My participation at the summer school PROMYS Europe at the University of Oxford also had no little part in my goal of becoming a research mathematician. It was also during that summer school that I fell in love with the historic British Universities. After graduating high school, I started my undergrad in mathematics at Trinity College of the University of Cambridge. The three-year course entitled "Mathematical Tripos" covered a wide range of topics, which increased choice as the years progressed. 

While my main interest was initially in Number Theory, I quickly discovered that modern-day research in this area looks very different from the classical Number Theory I knew from maths Olympiads. The ad-hoc nature and clever interplay of definitions I was so fond of quickly got lost in a sea of analytic tools and heavy machinery from algebra and geometry. After this realisation, I naturally turned to Combinatorics as a future prospect, given that most of the things I liked about Number Theory had some combinatorial flavour about them. I thoroughly enjoyed studying various areas of Combinatorics, though I soon realised that just as in Number Theory, the parts of the theory I enjoyed so much are often drowned out by probability theory and things like Fourier analysis. Fortunately, it was at that point, during my third year at Cambridge, that I got introduced to Mathematical Logic. As it turned out, the aspects of mathematics I had been enjoying so much all came together in the foundations of mathematics. It was not long before I also discovered Model Theory, Computation Theory and Set theory as my newfound passion. -->
