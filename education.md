I grew up in Zürich, Switzerland, and discovered my affinity for mathematics while participating
in many national and international [mathematics competitions](olympiad.html) during my high school
years at MNG Rämibühl. In 2018, I attended the [PROMYS Europe](https://promys-europe.org/) Summer School
in Oxford where I got my first taste of academia. For my high school graduation project in 2019,
I wrote an exposition entitled [On the Probabilistic Method and Permutations](matura.pdf).

### Undergrad

I received my bachelor's (**BA**) and master's (**MMath**) degrees in 2023 after completing
the full [Mathematical Tripos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Tripos) at Trinity College
of the University of Cambridge. Enjoying a wide range of [courses](/courses.html) on pure mathematics,
I soon discovered my passion for its foundations, in particular logic and computation theory.
I wrote my final master's project (Part III Essay) entitled
[Transfinite Context-Free Generative Grammars](/downloads/essay.pdf) on extensions of classical
formal language results to words of transfinite length under
[Benedikt Löwe](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/loewe/).

In spring 2026 I will be conferred an honorary Master's of Arts (**MA**) degree,
as is custom after undergrad studies at the University of Cambridge.

I held the positions of **Membership Secretary** (2020), **President** (2021), and **Constable** (2022)
at the [Trinity Mathematical Society](https://tms.soc.srcf.net/), the oldest subject society in England.
