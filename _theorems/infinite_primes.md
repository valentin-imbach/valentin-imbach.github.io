name: Infinitude of the Primes
---

There are infinitely many prime numbers.

#### Proof.
Assume that there are only fintely many primes and let $P$ denote their product. Since clearly $P\geq 1$, $P+1$ has a prime dicisor $p$. By construction we have $p\mid P$ and $p\mid P + 1$ inplying $p\mid 1$, a contradiction.
