Assume that there are only finitely many primes $p_1 < p_2 < \cdots < p_n$. Now consider $P = p_1p_2\cdots p_n$ and, using the fundamental theorem of arithmatic, pick a prime factor $p$ of $P+1$. But now by definition of $P$ we have $p \div P$ as well as $p\div P+1$, implying $p\div 1$, a contradiction.
