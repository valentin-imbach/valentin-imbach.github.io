# Hobbies

## Coding

I enjoy working on various coding projects, ranging widely in magnitude and scope. One of my long-term projects is coding my own video game with a custom game engine in c++, which I have been tinkering with for many years now. The vision is to eventually release a fully polished 2D, open-world, survival and exploration game with fully procedurally generated worlds. I want to achieve this while building all parts myself, including the code, art and music.

During high school, I took part in many programming competitions, most notably the International Informatics Olympiad, where the main choice of programming language was c++. To this day, c++ is my programming language of choice, however, over the years I've learned how to code in many other languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, Julia and some Haskel.

Other coding interests of mine include automated reasoning in mathematics, as well as proof and code verification. I'm quite interested in the topic of programming language design, and a fan of more niche languages such as [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)), as well as esoteric programming languages such as [Lorry](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Lorry) (that one's mine).

## Sports

While studying in the UK, I discovered Ultimate, a dynamic team sport played with a flying disc (commonly referred to as a Frisbee). Ever since, I've been playing very regularly for different teams, both in England as well as back home in Switzerland, competing in many national as well as international tournaments. The other sport I picked up during the years is bouldering, a form of rock climbing close to the ground with little necessary equipment.

## Music

Creating music is a big creative outlet for me. I took many years of clarinet lessons, and during high school, I taught myself how to play the piano. I've also have some experience playing the oboe and guitar, and I was a drummer in a rock band for a while. Nowadays however I mostly enjoy jazz improvisation on the piano.
