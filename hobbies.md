# Hobbies

Being a rather industrious individual, there are many other projects I am involved in. These include, but are certainly not limited to, such things as coding a video game, writing short stories and teaching myself jazz piano improvisation. Sports is a big passion of mine, offering a great balance to all the sitting and thinking I do. At the beginning of my university studies, I discovered to sport of Ultimate, a dynamic team sport played with a flying disc (also commonly refered to as a Frisbee). Ever since then I've been playing very regularly for different teams, both in England as well as back home in Switzerland, competing in many national as well as international tournaments. The other sport I picked up during my university years is bouldering, a form of rock climbing close to the ground with no necessary equipment.
