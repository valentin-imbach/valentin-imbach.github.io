I am the **Academic Director** at the [Swiss Mathematical Olympiad](https://mathematical.olympiad.ch/en/), an annual national mathematics competition. The primary purpose of the competition is to select a team to represent Switzerland at the [International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)](https://www.imo-official.org/), but we also send a team to the [Middle European Mathematical Olympiad (MEMO)](https://www.memo-official.org/MEMO/contests/previous/) every year. The national competition consists of several rounds, numerous preparation meetings, a training weekend, and a week-long camp for finalists, followed by many more events for those who qualify for international Olympiads. The competition covers topics that greatly differ from the school curriculum, focusing on logical thinking, creative problem-solving, and proofwriting. Every year, the Olympiad provides a platform for young people from all over Switzerland to interact and compete with like-minded peers, all while learning new mathematics.

Together with other volunteers, I create, supervise and correct exams, write teaching material, organise and implement training camps, and lead the best students to international competitions every year. One of my main contributions is the creation of [original problems](/portfolio.html) for the Swiss Mathematical Olympiad and various international contests. The Swiss Mathematical Olympiad is part of a larger network of [Swiss Science Olympiads](https://science.olympiad.ch/en/).

A detailed breakdown of my performance at the International Mathematical Olympiad can be found on [imo-official](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=27554). Besides the Swiss Mathematical Olympiad, I participated in various other training programs for mathematics competitions, including the [UZH Junior Euler Society](https://jes.math.uzh.ch/home) and the [ETH Youth Academy](https://educ.ethz.ch/lernzentren/mint-lernzentrum/ETH_Youth_Academy.html).

I also participated in some other science Olympiads, most notable the [International Olympiad in Informatics](https://ioinformatics.org/) (IOI).
- **Participation** (21%) at IOI 2019 in Azerbaijan
- **Gold Medal** at the Swiss Olympiad in Informatics 2019
- **Bronze Medal** at the Swiss Philosophy Olympiad 2019
- **Participation** (31%) at IOI 2018 in Japan
- **Silver Medal** at the Swiss Olympiad in Informatics 2018

In 2018 as well as 2019, I was given the award for "Best Swiss Interdisciplinary Achievement" by the association Swiss Science Olympiads. Moreover, my team and I got the award for "Best Swiss Team Achievement" for our perfrmance at IMO 2017.
