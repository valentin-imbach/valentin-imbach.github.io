# Olympiad

I am the Academic Director at the annual Swiss Mathematical Olympiad, a mathematical contest for high school pupils from all around Switzerland. Together with other volunteers, I create exam questions, write teaching material, organise training camps and acompany the best students every year to international competitions.

## About the Olympiad

The Swiss Mathematical Olympiad is an annual national mathematics competition organized by the *imosuisse* association. The association is primarily composed of former participants who are passionate about mathematics and are dedicated to sharing their knowledge and enthusiasm.

Each year, the Olympiad provides a platform for young mathematics enthusiasts from all over Switzerland to interact and compete. The competition consists of several rounds, numerous all-day preparation meetings, a training weekend, and a week-long camp for finalists. The competition covers topics that greatly differ from the school curriculum, focusing on logical thinking, creative problem-solving, and deductive reasoning. 

The Olympiad also serves as the official selection process for the Swiss delegations at International Mathematical competitions. These events offer a unique opportunity for young people to connect with likeminded peers from around the world and explore new countries and cultures.
