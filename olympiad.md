# Olympiad
I am the Academic Director at the [Swiss Mathematical Olympiad](https://mathematical.olympiad.ch/en/), an annual national mathematics competition. The primary purpose of the competition is to select a team to represent Switzerland at the [International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)](https://www.imo-official.org/). Each year, the Olympiad provides a platform for young mathematics enthusiasts from all over Switzerland to interact and compete. The competition covers topics that greatly differ from the school curriculum, focusing on logical thinking, creative problem-solving, and proof writing.

The national competition consists of several rounds, numerous preparation meetings, a training weekend, and a week-long camp for finalists, followed by many more events for those that qulaify for international Olympiads. These events offer a unique opportunity for young people to connect with likeminded peers from around the world and explore new countries and cultures. Together with other volunteers, I create exam questions, write teaching material, organise training camps and acompany the best students to international competitions every year. One of my main contributions is the creation of [original problems](/portfolio.html) for various Olympiads.
