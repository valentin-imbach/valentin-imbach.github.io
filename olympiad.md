# Olympiad
I am the **Academic Director** at the [Swiss Mathematical Olympiad](https://mathematical.olympiad.ch/en/), an annual national mathematics competition. The primary purpose of the competition is to select a team to represent Switzerland at the [International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)](https://www.imo-official.org/). The national competition consists of several rounds, numerous preparation meetings, a training weekend, and a week-long camp for finalists, followed by many more events for those who qualify for international Olympiads. The competition covers topics that greatly differ from the school curriculum, focusing on logical thinking, creative problem-solving, and proofwriting. Every year, the Olympiad provides a platform for young people from all over Switzerland to interact and compete with like-minded peers, all while learning new mathematics.

Together with other volunteers, I create, supervise and correct exams, write teaching material, organise and implement training camps, and lead the best students to international competitions every year. One of my main contributions is the creation of [original problems](/portfolio.html) for the Swiss Mathematical Olympiad and various international contests. The Swiss Mathematical Olympiad is part of a larger network of [Swiss Science Olympiads](https://science.olympiad.ch/en/).
