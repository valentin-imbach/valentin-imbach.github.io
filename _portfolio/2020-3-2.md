Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle. Denote by $M_A$, $M_B$ and $M_C$ the midpoints of sides $BC$, $CA$ and $AB$, respectively. Let $M_A'$, $M_B'$ and $M_C'$ be respectively the midpoints of the minor arcs $BC$, $CA$ and $AB$ on the circumcircle of $ABC$. Let $P_A$ be the intersection of the lines $M_BM_C$ and the perpendicular to $M_B' M_C'$ containing $A$. Let $P_B$ and $P_C$ be defined analogously. Prove that the lines $M_AP_A$, $M_BP_B$ and $M_CP_C$ meet at a point.
