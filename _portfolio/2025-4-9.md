Leo's garden has now been passed on to his niece Batlpàsz,
who is a bit disappointed by her inheritance at first.
However, one day, she gets a letter from Frieder telling her that there is buried
treasure under one of the $2025$ gnomes in the garden, but she doesn't know which one.
Some pairs of gnomes are directly connected by a dirt path,
and at most three dirt paths meet at each gnome.
Bàtlpasz can get from any gnome to any other gnome by walking along some of the dirt paths.
However, removing any single dirt path would split the gnomes into exactly
two separate connected groups, with no way to get from one group to the other.
In the middle of each dirt path is a fairy that can tell Batlpàsz which direction
along the path she has to go to get to the gnome with the treasure.
Every morning for a fortnight, Batlpàsz may ask a fairy for help.
After the fourteenth question, if Batlpàsz has not found the location of the treasure,
it will vanish. Can Batlpàsz always find the treasure, no matter how the dirt paths are arranged?
