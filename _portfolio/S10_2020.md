Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcircle $k$. Let $A_1,B_1$ and $C_1$ be points on the interior of the sides $BC,CA$ and $AB$ respectively. Let $X$ be a point on $k$ and denote by $Y$ the second intersection of the circumcircles of $BC_1X$ and $CB_1X$. Define the points $P$ and $Q$ to be the intersections of $BY$ with $B_1A_1$ and $CY$ with $C_1A_1$, respectively. Prove that $A$ lies on the line $PQ$.
