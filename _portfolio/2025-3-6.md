Let $n,a,b$ be positive integers with $n \geq 2$.
Aru and Wero are playing a game on a $n\times n$ grid.
At the beginning, there is a single pebble in the bottom-left corner.
A move consists of removing one pebble from some non-empty square $S$
and performing at least one (possibly both) of:

- adding $a$ pebbles to the right neighbour of $S$;
- adding $b$ pebbles to the upper neighbour of $S$.

Aru starts and they alternate moves. The first player that cannot make a move loses.
Determine who, if anyone, has a winning strategy in terms of $n, a, b$.
