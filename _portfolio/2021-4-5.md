Let $n$ be a positive integer. Some of the squares of a $3n \times 3n$ board are marked. For any marked square $T$, we denote by $\ell(T)$ the number of marked squares in the same row to the left of $T$ and by $d(T)$ the number of marked squares in the same column below $T$. Determine the maximal number of marked squares given that $\ell(T)+d(T)$ is even for every marked square $T$.
