Let $n$ be a positive integer. Prove that there exists a finite sequence $S$ consisting of only zeros and ones, satisfying the following property: For any positive integer $d\geq 2$, when $S$ is interpreted as a number in base $d$, the resulting number is non-zero and divisible by $n$.

*Remark: The sequence $S = s_ks_{k-1}\cdots s_1s_0$ interpreted in base $d$ is the number $\sum_{i = 0}^k s_id^i$*
