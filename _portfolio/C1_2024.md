Let $n$ be a positive integer. Annalena has $n$ different bowls numbered $1$ to $n$ and also $n$ apples, $2n$ bananas and $5n$ strawberries. She wants to combine ingredients in each bowl to make fruit salad. The fruit salad is \emph{delicious} if it contains  strictly more strawberries than bananas and strictly more bananas than apples. How many ways are there for Annalena to distribute all the fruits to make delicious fruit salad in each of the different bowls?

*Remark: A delicious fruit salad is allowed to not contain any apples.*
