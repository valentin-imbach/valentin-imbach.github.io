If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, we say that $a$ *almost divides* $b$ if $a$ divides at least one of $b-1$ and $b+1$. We call a positive integer $n$ *almost prime* if the following holds: for any  positive integers $a$, $b$ such that $n$ almost divides $ab$, we have that $n$ almost divides at least one of $a$ and $b$. Determine all almost prime numbers.
