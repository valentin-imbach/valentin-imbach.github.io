Anaëlle has $2n$ stones labelled $1,2,3,\ldots,2n$ as well as a red box and a blue box. She wants to put each of the $2n$ stones into one of the two boxes such that the stones $k$ and $2k$ are in different boxes for all $k=1,2,\dots,n$. How many possibilities does Anaëlle have to do so?

*Remark:* Partial points are awarded for computing the number of possibilities for any particular integer $n \geq 3$.
