For an integer $a\geq 2$, denote by $\delta(a)$ the second largest divisor of $a$. Let $(a_n)_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence of integers such that $a_1\geq 2$ and

$$a_{n+1} = a_n + \delta(a_n)$$

for all $n\geq 1$. Prove that there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $a_k$ is divisible by $3^{2022}$.
