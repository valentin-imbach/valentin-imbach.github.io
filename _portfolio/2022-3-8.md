Let $ABC$ be a triangle and let $P$ be a point in the interior of the side $BC$. Let $I_1$ and $I_2$ be the incenters of the triangles $APB$ and $APC$, respectively. Let $X$ be the closest point to $A$ on the line $AP$ such that $XI_1$ is perpendicular to $XI_2$. Prove that the distance $AX$ is independent of the choice of $P$.
