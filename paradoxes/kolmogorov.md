Consider the statement "Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer that cannot be defined in less than $20$ words".

There are only finitely many integers that can be discibed with less than $20$ words, so this statement indeed defines a unique positive integer $n$. By definition, it is impossible to define this $n$ in less than $20$ words. However, the above statement defines it in less than $20$ words.
