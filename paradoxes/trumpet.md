name: Trumpet Paradox

Consider the trumpet-like shape obtained by rotating the graph of $y = 1/(x+1)$ around the $x$ for for $x \geq 0$. The surface area of this trumpet is infinite becasue the integral
$$\int_{x = 0}^\infty 2\pi/(x+1)$$
diverges. However, the volume enclosed by the trumpet is given by
$$\int_{x = 0}^\infty \pi/(x+1)^2 = \pi (-1/(x+1))|_{x = 0}^\infty = \pi.$$
Thus, painting the inside of the trumpet would require an ininite amount of paint, while filling the trumpet entirely with paint only takes a finite amount of paint.
