abstract: I did my integrated bachelors' and masters' degree in mathematics at the University of Cambridge, focussing on pure mathematics. Starting out with a flair for number theory and combinatorics, I eventually discovered my passion and afinity for mathematical logic and computation theory. After taking a year off from academia to serve in the mandatory Swiss civil service, I am now pursuing my PhD at EPF Lausanne in Switzerland, where I hope to contribute to research in complexity theory and related fields.

# Academia

It was during my highschool years that I decided to pursue matheamtics at university. At the time, I participated in many mathematics competitions, through which I discovered my passion for the subject. My participation at the summer school PROMYS Europe at teh University of Oxford also had no little part in my goal of becomimg a research mathematician. It was also during that summer school that I fell in love with the historic British Universities. After graduationg highschool, I started my undegrad in mathematics at Trinity College of the University of Cambridge. The three year cours entitled "Mathematical Tripos" covered a wide range of topics, witch increaing choice as the years progressed. 

While my main interest was initially in Number Theory, I quickly discovered that modern-day reasearch in this area looks very diffrent from the classical Number Theory I knew from maths Olympiads. The ad-hoc nature and clever interplay of definitions I was so fond of quickly gets lost in a sea of analytic tools and heavy machinary from algebra and geometry. After this realisation, I naturally turned to Combinatorics as a future prospect, given that most of the things I liked about Number Theory had some combinatorial flavour about them. I thoroughly enjoyed studying various areas of Combinatorics, though I soon realised that just as in Number Theory, the parts of the theory I enjoyed so much are often drownd out by probability thoery and things like fourier analysis. Fortunately, it was at that point, during my third year at Cambridge, that I got introduced to Mathematical Logic. As it turned out, the aspects of methamtics I had been enjoying so much all came together in the foundations of mathematics. It was not long before I also discovered Model Theory, Computation Theory and Set Thoery as my newfound passion.

Additionally, during the second and third year, I worked on computational projects.


As part of my degree, I wrote an Essay entitled "Transfinite Context-Free Generative Grammars" where I extend several results from classical Formal Language Theory to words of transfinite length.
