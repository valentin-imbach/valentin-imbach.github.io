My main research interests lie in the interplay between mathematical foundations and computation theory. In particular, they include Complexity Theory, Computability Theory, Automata and Formal Language Theory and related fields.

I am currently working towards new lower bounds in randomised, constant-cost communication complexity.

Some other reasearch areas that fascinate me include
- Reverse Mathematics and new foundations
- Nonstandard Analysis
- Large Cardinal Axioms
- Automated Theory Proving and Computer Formalisation
- Tiling Problems

I am loosely affiliated with a research effort led by Timothy Gowers on [Human Oriented Automated Theorem Proving](https://wtgowers.github.io/human-style-atp/)
