### GÃ¶del through a Computational Lense

Definition (Algorithm).
An *algorithm* is a finite discription of a procedure that specifies unambiguously how to perform a sequence of *elementary operations* on some *inputs* to produce some *outputs*. This sequence is called a *computation* and it might or might not eventually *halt*.

The exact meaning of elematary operation and the types of input and outputs, as well as the language in which the algorithm is specified all depend on the model of computation in consideration. Some particular models of computation one can define include Turing machines, lambda calculus, recusive functions and many more. However TODO

Note that while the discription of an algorithm must be finite, it can make use of loops or recursion to give rise to computations that potentially go on forever.
